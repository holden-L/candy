## Candy Game
A simple 2D game written in Python 2.X, with the Pygame module.
I wrote it as a first project using OOP and multiple files, as well as to familiarize myself with Pygame.
None of the artwork or sounds are my own.

**Prerequisites**

* Python
* Pygame

**To Run**

1. Download all files.
2. Navigate to the directory with main.py.
3. Run "python main.py".

**To Do**

* Make candies automatically move after a period of time.
* Create a gameover, based on how many candies have been missed.
* Keep track of the store in window, rather than printing it to a terminal after the game finishes.
